# Web Manifesto
Technology is simply a tool used to enhance our information experience, **it is not the goal**.

Often overlooked in web development is the human. We think about design, we think about the technology, and we put effort into both. Design *should* include human factors, but often we rely on assumptions and not user research (or lessons from psychology, human behavior studies, or neuroeconomics). 

Avoid self-centered design by following the driving principles outlined below.

## Driving Principles

### Mindful Design
Simply be aware, realize we are not our users, and recognize when we base decisions on assumptions. 

### Inclusive Design
The content is written and designed for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, and emotional state.

### Universal Design
The content is written and designed for everyone regardless of physical ability, device used to access, and the limitations the device forces on the human.

### Accessible Design (Accessibility)
A mismatch in interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live must not prevent the person from accessing content. Content may be interacted with while using assistive technologies and the shortcomings of technology do not prevent someone from accessing content.

### Responsible Design (Sustainability)
Design is optimized and light weight. Do not assume people have unlimited data. Optimized code reduces carbon footprint, and all hardware is also sustainable and efficient.

### Ethical Design
Design for well being; do not abuse people's attention, designing attention-grabbing techniques to the detriment of our health or interferes with the person's goal. Avoid dark and anti patterns.

We have a responsibility to create a better future.
