# Web Manifesto
Technology is simply a tool used to enhance our information experience, **it is not the goal**. 

Avoid self-centered design by following the driving principles outlined below.

## Driving Principles

### Mindful Design
Be aware, realize we are not our users, and recognize when we base decisions on assumptions. Be intentional.

### Inclusive Design
Write content designed for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, and emotional state.

### Universal Design
Write content designed for everyone regardless of physical ability, device used to access, and the limitations the device forces on the human.

### Accessible Design (Accessibility)
A mismatch in interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live must not prevent the person from accessing content. IThe use of assistive technologies and the shortcomings of technology must not prevent access.

### Responsible or Elegant Design (Sustainability)
Optimize design and be light weight. Do not assume people have unlimited data. Optimized code reduces carbon footprint, and all hardware is also sustainable and efficient.

### Ethical Design
Design for well being; do not abuse people's attention by designing attention-grabbing techniques to the detriment of our health or interferes with the person's goal. Avoid dark and anti patterns, don't introduce obstacles to the content.

We have a responsibility to create a better future.
